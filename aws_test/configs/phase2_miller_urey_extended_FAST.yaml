# Phase 2B - Miller-Urey Extended Configuration - FAST MODE
# ==============================================
# 
# Fast mode for production runs:
# - Novelty detection COMPLETELY DISABLED during simulation
# - Will be run as offline batch job after simulation
# - Optimized for speed: ~100x faster than regular mode
# 
# Expected execution time: ~1-2 hours for 500K steps (vs 35 days)
