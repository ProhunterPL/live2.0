# Phase 2B - Miller-Urey Extended Configuration - OPTIMIZED
# ==============================================
# 
# Optimized for local GPU execution with:
# - Reduced novelty detection frequency (10000 steps vs 500)
# - Smaller particle count (1500 vs 2000)
# - Fewer atoms per molecule
# 
# Expected outcomes:
# - Faster execution (1-2 hours vs 10+ hours)
# - Same scientific validity
# - Reduced resource usage
