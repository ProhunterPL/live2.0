"""
Benchmark Reactions Test Suite
================================

Tests Live 2.0 simulation against known prebiotic chemistry reactions:

1. Formose Reaction (Breslow 1959)
2. Strecker Synthesis (Miller 1953)
3. HCN Polymerization (Oró 1960)
4. Phosphorylation reactions
5. Detailed balance validation

All tests compare simulation results with experimental literature values.
