# Fast Cluster Detection Configuration
# Optimized for quicker novel substance detection and more stable clusters

mode: "open_chemistry"

# Simulation basics
grid_width: 128
grid_height: 128
dt: 0.1
max_particles: 500

# FASTER NOVELTY DETECTION (was 700)
novelty_check_interval: 200  # Check every 200 steps instead of 700
min_cluster_size: 3          # Still require meaningful clusters (3+ particles)
detect_novel_substances: true

# IMPROVED CLUSTER STABILITY
# Reduce max bond length for more realistic, stable bonds
# Note: This requires code change in binding.py
# Currently: PARTICLE_RADIUS * 6.8 = 3.4 units (too long!)
# Recommended: PARTICLE_RADIUS * 4.0 = 2.0 units (realistic)

binding_threshold: 0.5        # Moderate permissiveness
unbinding_threshold: 0.15     # REDUCED from 0.18 - more stable bonds

# Particle settings
particle_radius: 0.5

# Energy settings
energy_transfer_rate: 0.01
energy_dissipation: 0.01

# Visualization - more frequent updates
vis_frequency: 10            # Update every 10 steps
log_frequency: 200           # Log every 200 steps

# Validation
validate_every_n_steps: 300

momentum_tolerance: 0.0002

# Mutations - balanced for sustained novelty
p_mut_base: 0.003
p_mut_gain: 30.0
attr_sigma: 0.15

# Performance note:
# - More frequent novelty checks (200 vs 700) = ~10% slower
# - More frequent validation (300 vs 300) = same
# - Worth it for faster cluster detection!

# To use this config:
# 1. Copy to configs/fast_cluster_detection.yaml
# 2. In backend, start with:
#    python -m backend.api.server --config configs/fast_cluster_detection.yaml
# 3. Or create simulation with this config via API
