## 📝 Notes

- **PDF Formatting Issues**: If words appear merged in the PDF (e.g., "isthebonddissociationenergy"), this is likely a PDF rendering issue, not a LaTeX source problem. The LaTeX source has proper spacing.
- **Recompilation**: After applying fixes, recompile the PDF in Overleaf to verify all changes appear correctly.
