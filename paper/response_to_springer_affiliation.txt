Dear Editorial Team,

Thank you for your email regarding the author affiliation in the submission system.

I have updated the author affiliation in the system to match the manuscript. As an independent researcher, I added the affiliation as follows:

**Steps I completed in the submission system:**
1. In the Authors tab → Affiliated Institutions section, I selected "Add manually"
2. I filled in the required details:
   - Institution Name: Independent Researcher
   - Country: Poland
   - City: Pruszcz Gdański
3. I selected "Add Institution"
4. In the Author's information section, I selected "Independent Researcher" as the Primary Affiliation

The manuscript already contains the correct affiliation: "Independent Researcher, Pruszcz Gdański, Poland" (as updated in the previous revision).

The system update has been completed.

Thank you for your guidance.

Best regards,
Michał Klawikowski
Independent Researcher
