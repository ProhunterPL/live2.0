Dear Editorial Team,

Thank you for your feedback on our manuscript. I have addressed both points:

1. **Title revision**: I have revised the title to remove punctuation and make it more concise. The new title is:
   - **"Emergent Molecular Complexity in Prebiotic Chemistry Simulations Using a Physics-Based Approach"**
   
   This title is now a single, clear sentence without colons or hyphens, while maintaining the scientific meaning and informativeness.

2. **Data availability statement**: I have updated the Data and Code Availability section to comply with your data deposition policy. The section now states:
   - "All simulation data, analysis code, and visualization scripts are publicly available. Raw simulation outputs are deposited in Zenodo (https://zenodo.org, accession number: 10.5281/zenodo.17911552)."
   
   The GitHub reference has been removed, and the data availability statement now includes the full database name (Zenodo) and the accession number as required.

The revised manuscript will be resubmitted with these changes.

Thank you for your guidance.

Best regards,
Michał Klawikowski
Independent Researcher
