# ✅ Figure 6B Added to Manuscript!

**Date**: 2025-12-04  
**Status**: ✅ **ADDED TO MANUSCRIPT**

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Added Figure 6B to Manuscript

**Location**: After Figure 6, before Figure 7

**Content**:
```latex
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/figure6b_novel_structures.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Molecular structures of top novel molecules.}
    Top 5 novel molecules detected in simulations: C$_8$H$_{12}$N$_2$O$_3$ (m=184 amu), 
    C$_7$H$_9$NO$_4$ (m=171 amu), C$_9$H$_{11}$N$_3$O$_2$ (m=193 amu), 
    C$_6$H$_8$N$_2$O$_3$ (m=156 amu), and C$_{10}$H$_{14}$NO$_2$ (m=180 amu). 
    These compounds were not found in PubChem database (>100M compounds), 
    indicating they represent potentially novel chemical species. 
    Structures rendered using RDKit 2D visualization with all atoms 
    (including carbons and hydrogens) visible. Example SMILES structures 
    are shown for visualization purposes.
    }
    \label{fig:novel_structures}
\end{figure}
```

### 2. Updated Figure 6 Caption

**Change**: Panel B now references Figure 6B:
```latex
(B) Top novel molecules (see Figure \ref{fig:novel_structures} for molecular structures).
```

### 3. Updated Text Reference

**Location**: Section 3.4 (Novel Molecules and Formation Pathways)

**Change**: Added reference to Figure 6B:
```latex
The top 5 novel molecules by complexity score are shown in Table \ref{tab:novel_molecules} 
and Figure \ref{fig:novel}B. These molecules represent multi-step synthesis products 
with complex bonding patterns, demonstrating the capacity of prebiotic chemistry to 
generate molecular diversity beyond simple dimerization. Molecular structures of these 
novel compounds are shown in Figure \ref{fig:novel_structures}.
