### Step 4: Cover Letter Template

**For Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres:**

```
Dear Editor,

I am submitting our manuscript entitled "Emergent Molecular Complexity in Prebiotic Chemistry Simulations: A Physics-Based Approach" for consideration for publication in Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres.

This work presents a novel physics-based simulation framework for exploring prebiotic chemistry that combines molecular dynamics with emergent bond formation. Unlike previous computational approaches that either require predefined reaction rules or are computationally prohibitive, our method discovers novel reactions and autocatalytic networks through purely physical processes.

Key findings:
- 2,315 unique molecular species detected across three prebiotic scenarios
- 769,315 autocatalytic cycles identified, demonstrating spontaneous self-organization
- Scenario-specific chemical signatures provide testable predictions for experimental validation

This work addresses fundamental questions in the origin of life by demonstrating that chemical complexity and autocatalytic organization emerge inevitably from simple precursors under appropriate thermodynamic conditions. The results support a deterministic view of chemical evolution and provide quantitative predictions for discriminating between competing origin-of-life hypotheses.

The manuscript is original, has not been published elsewhere, and is not under consideration by any other journal. All data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/ProhunterPL/live2.0.

Thank you for considering this manuscript.

Sincerely,
Michał Klawikowski
