Dear Editorial Team,

Thank you for your additional feedback on our manuscript (ID: 5a16c805-7ec9-4f82-9233-6bb6bb857971 v1.0).

I have addressed all the requested points:

1. **Tables 3 and 4**: I have removed the placeholder references to Tables 3 and 4 from the manuscript. These were draft placeholders that were not intended to be included in the final version. The manuscript now only references the tables that are actually included (Tables 5 and 6 in the main text, and Tables S1 and S2 in Supplementary Information).

2. **Supplementary figures and tables**: I have updated the manuscript to properly reference Table S1 and Table S2 in the Supplementary Information section. The supplementary tables (Table S1: Complete physical parameter database, and Table S2: Complete network metrics) will be uploaded in the 'Supplementary' tab of the submission system.

3. **Author affiliation**: I have updated the author affiliation in the manuscript to "Independent Researcher, Pruszcz Gdański, Poland" as requested. I will also update the affiliation in the submission system to match:
   - Institution: Independent Researcher
   - Country: Poland
   - City: Pruszcz Gdański

4. **City and Country**: The manuscript now includes "Independent Researcher, Poland" as the affiliation with country information.

All changes have been made to the manuscript. The revised version will be resubmitted along with the supplementary materials in the appropriate tabs.

Thank you for your guidance.

Best regards,
Michał Klawikowski
Independent Researcher
