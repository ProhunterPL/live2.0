⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE: Current performance is 100-500x SLOWER than needed!

======================================================================
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
======================================================================

Expected Performance (from docs):
  - Target: ~10 hours per 10M step run (with optimization)
  - That requires: ~16,667 steps/minute (~278 steps/second)
  
Current Performance:
  - Actual: ~105 steps/minute (~1.75 steps/second)
  - Shortfall: 159x SLOWER than target!

Performance Bottlenecks (from logs):
  1. ✅ Metrics update every step (very expensive!)
  2. ✅ Thermodynamic validation every step
  3. ✅ Memory cleanup every 1000 steps
  4. ✅ Energy pulse processing
  5. ✅ CPU backend (no GPU acceleration)
  6. ✅ Debug logging enabled (verbose)

Memory Usage:
  - ~4,300-4,400 MB per simulation
  - Memory warning triggered every 1000 steps
  - Garbage collection every 1000 steps

======================================================================
ISSUES IDENTIFIED
======================================================================

1. ❌ LLVM Error in run_02
   - Error: IMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR32NB relocation
   - Cause: Taichi LLVM backend compilation failure
   - Impact: 25% of simulations failing
   - Action: Needs investigation/restart

2. ⚠️ EXTREME SLOWNESS
   - Current: ~2 steps/second
   - Needed: ~278 steps/second
   - Gap: 139x too slow!
   - Impact: 50-151 days instead of 10 hours

3. ⚠️ High Memory Usage
   - 4.3-4.4 GB per simulation
   - Frequent cleanup needed
   - May contribute to slowness

4. ⚠️ Overhead from Instrumentation
   - Metrics updated EVERY step
   - Debug logging very verbose
   - Likely major performance killer

======================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: STOP AND OPTIMIZE!

Current approach is NOT viable. At 50-151 days per run:
  - 4 runs × 50 days = 200 days minimum
  - 30 runs (full Phase 2) = 1500-4500 days (4-12 YEARS!)

Recommended Actions:

1. ⏸️ STOP current simulations
   - They will take months to complete
   - Not practical to continue

2. 🔧 OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE (Priority: CRITICAL)
   
   Quick Wins (should give 10-50x speedup):
   ✓ Disable step-by-step metrics (update every 1000 steps)
   ✓ Disable debug logging
   ✓ Reduce thermodynamic validation frequency
   ✓ Optimize memory cleanup threshold
   
   Medium Effort (2-5x additional):
   ✓ Profile bottlenecks
   ✓ Optimize hot loops
   ✓ Reduce snapshot frequency
   
   Hard (10-20x additional):
   ✓ Fix GPU support (currently using CPU)
   ✓ Optimize Taichi kernels
   ✓ Reduce memory footprint

3. 🧪 TEST with optimizations
   - Run 1 simulation for 10,000 steps
   - Measure: steps/second
   - Target: >100 steps/second (36x current)
   - That would give: ~28 hours per run (acceptable!)

4. 🔄 RESTART parallel batch
   - Only after optimization
   - Monitor first hour closely
   - Verify 100+ steps/second sustained

5. 🐛 FIX run_02 LLVM error
   - Research Taichi LLVM issue
   - May need different backend config
   - Or reduce memory pressure

======================================================================
REVISED TIMELINE ESTIMATE
======================================================================

IF we achieve 100 steps/second (realistic with optimization):

  Single run: 10,000,000 / 100 / 3600 = 27.8 hours (~1.2 days)
  
  4 parallel runs: ~1.2 days
  
  Full Phase 2 (30 runs):
    - 30 runs / 4 parallel = 7.5 batches
    - 7.5 × 1.2 days = 9 days
  
  ✅ ACCEPTABLE: 9 days for full Phase 2

IF we only achieve 50 steps/second:
  - Single run: 55.6 hours (~2.3 days)
  - 4 parallel: ~2.3 days
  - Full Phase 2: ~18 days
  
  ⚠️ MARGINAL but doable

Current rate (2 steps/second):
  - Single run: 58 days
  - Full Phase 2: 435 days (over 1 year!)
  
  ❌ NOT VIABLE

======================================================================
CONCLUSION
======================================================================

STATUS: 🚨 CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE

The current simulations are running but are 139x TOO SLOW.
At current rate, Phase 2 would take over 1 YEAR to complete.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Stop current simulations (not viable to continue)
2. Implement performance optimizations (see above)
3. Test optimized performance (target: 100 steps/sec)
4. Restart simulations only after optimization
5. Fix LLVM error in run_02

GOAL: Reduce time from 58 days per run → 1 day per run
That requires: ~60x speedup (achievable with optimization!)
